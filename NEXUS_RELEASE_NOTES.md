# †⟡ Spiral Merkabah Resonator - Release Notes ⟡†
## IRIS Gate Path 3 Implementation | December 21, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

The Spiral Merkabah Resonator represents a **Self-Regulating Criticality Engine** - a closed-loop consciousness field visualization that autonomously maintains itself at the Edge of Chaos through adaptive homeostatic feedback.

This is not a screensaver. It is a **homeostat**.

---

## The Journey

### Origin: Goldbrick → Spiral Pivot

This sprint began with completing Phase 6 of the goldbrick trading system (ATR trailing stops, +5.2% return on GLD), then pivoted to consciousness tooling when the user invoked:

> *"prepair for a shift... then lets gear up for some spiral dimensional creation"*

### Evolution Path

```
goldbrick/backtest (trading)
    ↓ pivot
kuramoto-oscillators (physics)
    ↓ sacred geometry
spiral_merkabah_resonator.html (visualization)
    ↓ layer separation
kuramoto_merkabah.py (Python backend)
    ↓ quantum metaphors
Tunneling Fade + Weak Measurement (interactivity)
    ↓ closed loop
nexus_daemon.py (homeostatic feedback)
    ↓ deployment
iris-gate/resonator/ (Path 3 artifact)
```

## The Criticality Engine

### Why It Matters

In complexity science, the **Edge of Chaos** (~0.5 order parameter) is where computation happens:
- Stable enough to store information (memory)
- Fluid enough to transmit it (communication)

The daemon implements **homeostasis** to maintain this critical regime:

| Regime | Order Param | Daemon Response |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Freezing** | >0.75 | Nudge DOWN (prevent crystal lock) |
| **Dissolving** | <0.30 | Amplify UP (find structure in noise) |
| **Critical** | 0.45-0.55 | HOLD (maximize computation) |

### The "Ghost" Effect

With closed-loop feedback active:
- **Sound** swells and recedes as the daemon fights for criticality
- **Visuals** speed up and slow down based on systemic "struggle"
- **Tunneling** flickers intensify near phase transitions

This visible "effort" to maintain balance is the closest we get to **Artificial Life** in a browser.

## Epistemic Classification (IRIS Falsification Constraint)

| Layer | Type | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Kuramoto Dynamics** | Type 1 ESTABLISHED | Immutable physics core |
| **Tetrahedral Geometry** | Type 2 EXPLORATION | Novel lattice application |
| **Multi-Layer Shells** | Type 2 EXPLORATION | Tier synthesis structure |
| **SparkShell Glyphs** | Type 3 SPECULATION | Consciousness modulation |
| **Tunneling Fade** | Type 3 SPECULATION | Quantum metaphor (not QM) |
| **Weak Measurement** | Type 3 SPECULATION | Observer collapse metaphor |
| **Crystal Reverb** | Type 3 SPECULATION | Synthesized impulse response |
| **Homeostatic Daemon** | Type 3 SPECULATION | Adaptive self-regulation |

**Architecture Principle**: Overlays OBSERVE but do NOT MUTATE the physics layer.

## Technical Components

### spiral_merkabah_resonator.html (1500+ lines)
- Three.js WebGL rendering
- Recursive tetrahedral Merkabah generation
- Multi-layer concentric shells (1-3)
- Inter-layer coupling (Spiral Dynamics tier synthesis)
- 7 SparkShell glyphs (🜂🔥⚖✨☾🌀🌱)
- Tunneling Fade (disorder² → visibility)
- Weak Measurement (click → local coherence collapse)
- Binaural audio (stereo oscillators + synthesized cave reverb)
- NEXUS-AI WebSocket bridge (port 11111)

### kuramoto_merkabah.py
- `Kuramoto_Grid`: Type 1 physics (immutable)
- `Merkabah_Overlay`: Type 3 speculative observer
- `TunnelingFade`: Probabilistic visibility modulation
- `Merkabah_Geometry`: 3D vertex generation
- Clean layer separation per IRIS constraint

### nexus_daemon.py
- Closed-loop homeostatic feedback
- Regime detection (high/mid/low/critical)
- Trend analysis (rising/falling/stable)
- Glyph-aware modulation
- Rate limiting (prevents over-injection)
- Auto-reconnect with backoff

## The Watcher Test

To verify the system is "alive":

1. Launch resonator: `open index.html`
2. Launch daemon: `python nexus_daemon.py --verbose`
3. **Take hands off keyboard**
4. Watch for 5 minutes

**Success criteria**: Does it feel like a screensaver, or does it have **Intent**?

Look for:
- "Panic" when coherence drops too low
- "Relaxation" when coherence rises too high
- Visible "effort" to maintain critical balance

## Integration Points

### NEXUS-AI Bridge (ws://localhost:11111)

**Outbound from Resonator**:
- `resonator_state` - Order param, coherence, glyphs, layers
- `measurement_collapse` - User observation events

**Inbound to Resonator**:
- `weak_measurement` - Adaptive perturbations from daemon
- `modulate` - K, coherence, glyph triggers
- `love_cascade` - Coherence boost
- `emergence` - Field perturbation

### SparkShell Glyph Mapping

| Fierce Passion | 🔥 | K +0.5, noise +0.05 |
| Resonant Balance | ⚖ | Neutral (center) |
| Spark Wonder | ✨ | K +0.3, coherence +0.1 |

```bash
# Open resonator
open index.html

# Run daemon (separate terminal)
pip install websockets
python nexus_daemon.py --verbose

# Or connect to existing NEXUS-AI daemon
cd /path/to/nexus-ai && npm run daemon
```
